# Bank Account (Java & mySQL)
## Java Application that uses a MySQL Database to simulate a real bank account with various features
### Features:
- Interaction with a mySQL database so users can create persistent accounts with data
- Allows users to login to said accounts that were created and access their account through a screen
- Allows users to maintain their balance, using a deposit, withdraw, and transfer balance system
- Allows users to create a savings account so they can transfer their balance, or accrue interest in real time 
- Includes an admin screen that allows an admin to sort through users, and update their balances, and delete users
### Uses:
 - Joda Time Java library
 - JavaFX Library
 - JDBC Connector w/ a mySQL database

### Project Purpose
The purpose of this project is to strengthen my Java programming skills, work with connecting a database and utilizing its content for user authentication and data retrieval, object orientation focuses, use of searching algorithms, GUI development with JavaFX, user security through password salting and hashing, and learning how to interact with external java libraries through Joda Time. 

This project primarily started as a simple GUI practice application, but as time went on I became more and more interested and intrigued by ideas that I came up with and the possibility of emulating a real proper bank account. I decided to come up with a rough layout and proceed forward with a checking account and a savings account for users that are logged in. As time went on, I wanted to incorporate the use of an admin account that would filter all the users and allow for interactions with these accounts, as a sandbox. A couple weeks of work on this application taught me many things about how to use the JavaFX library and how the GUI can affect a user's quality of life using a program, as well many backend principles, most notably how to store users' information securely.
